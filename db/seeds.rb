The décor consists of a copper bar, white walls, wood furnishings, mirrors and artwork created by Rachelle Vivian. The menu is geared towards carnivores, with apps like lamb, pork and seafood, and mains like the Beast burger, pig’s head, duck and elk. Brunch is fashioned the same way, with a pastrami sandwich, beef rib eye and duck confit, as well as the regular stuff like French toast, eggs and bacon.",
